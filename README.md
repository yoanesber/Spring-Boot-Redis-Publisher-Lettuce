# Order Payment Service with Redis

## üìñ Overview
This project implements an **Order Payment Service** that integrates with **Redis** to **publish payment status messages**. It leverages **Spring Boot**, **Redis with Lettuce**, and a **structured event-driven approach** to notify other services about successful or failed payment transactions.  

### üóÇÔ∏è What is Redis?
**Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)** is an **in-memory, key-value data store known for its speed, flexibility, and scalability**. It is widely used for **caching, real-time messaging, session management, leaderboards, and job queuing**. It is often referred to as a **data structures server**. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.  

#### üöÄ Key Features of Redis
- **Blazing Fast** ‚Äì Data is stored in memory, making reads/writes extremely fast.
- **Supports Data Structures** ‚Äì Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets, Streams, Pub/Sub, etc.
- **Persistence** ‚Äì Data can be persisted to disk using RDB (snapshotting) or AOF (append-only file).
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Supports clustering and replication for high availability.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging** ‚Äì Used for real-time notifications and distributed systems.

#### üíº Common Business Use Cases for Redis Message Types
Redis **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** is often used in business applications for **real-time event-driven messaging**. Here are some common message types:  

1. Order Processing System (E-commerce)  
Message Types:  
    - ORDER_PLACED ‚Äì When a customer places an order.
    - PAYMENT_SUCCESS ‚Äì Payment is successful.
    - PAYMENT_FAILED ‚Äì Payment is declined.
    - ORDER_SHIPPED ‚Äì Order has been shipped.
    - ORDER_DELIVERED ‚Äì Order is delivered to the customer.

    **Use Case**: Notify users in real-time about their order status.  

2. Payment Processing & Fraud Detection (Fintech)  
Message Types:  
    - PAYMENT_INITIATED ‚Äì When a user initiates a payment.
    - PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED ‚Äì When payment is authorized.
    - PAYMENT_REJECTED ‚Äì Payment failed due to insufficient funds or fraud detection.
    - PAYMENT_REFUNDED ‚Äì When a refund is issued.
    - FRAUD_ALERT ‚Äì When fraud is detected.

    **Use Case**:  
    - Notify customers of payment transactions.
    - Alert fraud detection systems to take action.

3. Notification & Alerts System  
Message Types:  
    - NEW_MESSAGE ‚Äì A user receives a new message in a chat app.
    - NEW_COMMENT ‚Äì Someone comments on a post.
    - FRIEND_REQUEST ‚Äì A new friend request is received.
    - PROMOTIONAL_OFFER ‚Äì A business sends discounts to customers.
    - SYSTEM_ALERT ‚Äì A critical error occurs (e.g., server downtime alert).

    **Use Case**:  
    - Real-time user notifications for chat apps like WhatsApp or Slack.
    - Push notifications for social media updates.


4. Real-Time Stock Market & Trading Platforms (Finance)  
Message Types:  
    - STOCK_PRICE_UPDATE ‚Äì Stock price updates every second.
    - TRADE_EXECUTED ‚Äì A stock trade is completed.
    - MARKET_NEWS_UPDATE ‚Äì News impacting the stock market.
    - PORTFOLIO_ALERT ‚Äì Portfolio value changes significantly.

    **Use Case**: Stock trading apps like Robinhood use Redis for real-time price updates.  

5. IoT & Real-Time Sensor Data (Smart Devices)  
Message Types:  
    - TEMPERATURE_UPDATE ‚Äì Sends real-time temperature readings.
    - MOTION_DETECTED ‚Äì Security camera detects movement.
    - DEVICE_HEALTH_CHECK ‚Äì IoT device reports its health.

    **Use Case**: Smart home automation, monitoring energy consumption, and security alerts.  


### ü•¨ What is Lettuce?

**Lettuce** is a **scalable**, **high-performance**, and **non-blocking** Redis client for Java. It is also a **reactive and thread-safe** Redis client built on `Netty`. It supports both **synchronous and asynchronous (reactive)** interactions with Redis.  

#### üöÄ Key Features of Lettuce
- Supports Asynchronous & Reactive APIs (using CompletableFuture, RxJava, and Project Reactor).
- Thread-Safe Connections (multiple threads can use a single connection).
- Automatic Reconnection & Cluster Support.
- Built on Netty (High Performance, Non-Blocking IO).
- Supports Redis Pub/Sub & Redis Streams.

This project uses `LettuceConnectionFactory` to configure Redis connections with shared **ClientResources**. This connection factory is used by `RedisTemplate` to interact with Redis, enabling efficient message publishing and retrieval. The `RedisPublisher` service is responsible for publishing messages to the appropriate Redis channels (**PAYMENT_SUCCESS** and **PAYMENT_FAILED**).  


### üõí Order Payment Service

The **Order Payment Service** provides **REST APIs** to create and process payment transactions. The main flow involves:
1. Validating the Request ‚Äì Ensuring the order exists, amount is valid, etc.
2. Calling Payment Gateway ‚Äì Fetching transaction details (e.g., transactionId, paymentStatus).
3. Persisting Order Payment ‚Äì Storing payment transaction details in the database.
4. Publishing Payment Status:
    - If `paymentStatus = SUCCESS`, publish to `PAYMENT_SUCCESS` channel.
    - If an exception occurs during processing, publish to `PAYMENT_FAILED` channel with an error message.

The `processPayment` method determines the flow based on paymentMethod (**CREDIT_CARD**, **PAYPAL**, **BANK_TRANSFER**), handling specific conditions for each type.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.  
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoanesber/Spring-Boot-Redis-Publisher-Lettuce.git
cd Spring-Boot-Redis-Publisher-Lettuce
```

2. Ensure Redis is installed and running:
```bash
redis-server
```

3. (Optional) If you want to add a specific user with access to a specific channel, you can run the following command in Redis CLI:
```bash
ACL SETUSER your_user +CHANNEL~your_channel on >your_password
```

4. Set up Redis password in `.env.development` file:
```properties
# Redis properties
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_password
```

5. Build and run the application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

6. Use API endpoints to test payment processing.

    "message": "Order payment created successfully",
    "data": {
        "orderId": "ORD123456789",
        "transactionId": "TXN1742200119003",
        "paymentStatus": "SUCCESS",
        "amount": 199.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "paymentMethod": "PAYPAL",
        "createdAt": "2025-03-17T08:28:39.003556100Z"
    }
}
```

**Body Request (BANK_TRANSFER):**
```json
{
    "orderId":"ORD123456789",
    "amount":"199.99",
    "currency":"USD",
    "paymentMethod":"BANK_TRANSFER",
    "bankAccount":"1234567890",
    "bankName":"Bank of Indonesia"
}
```

**Successful Response (BANK_TRANSFER):**
```json
{
    "statusCode": 201,
    "timestamp": "2025-03-17T08:28:29.806174300Z",
    "message": "Order payment created successfully",
    "data": {
        "orderId": "ORD123456789",
        "transactionId": "TXN1742200108505",
        "paymentStatus": "SUCCESS",
        "amount": 199.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER",
        "createdAt": "2025-03-17T08:28:28.505517700Z"
    }
}
```

**Invalid Request:**
```json
{
    "orderId":"ORD123456789",
    "amount":"199.99",
    "currency":"USD",
    "paymentMethod":"CREDITCARD",
    "cardNumber":"1234 5678 9012 3456",
    "cardExpiry":"31/12",
    "cardCvv":"123"
}
```

In the JSON request above, we use `"paymentMethod":"CREDITCARD"`, which should be `"paymentMethod":"CREDIT_CARD"`, to test an invalid request.  
This ensures the API correctly validates input and returns an appropriate error response for unsupported or incorrectly formatted values.  

**Invalid Response:**
```json
{
    "statusCode": 500,
    "timestamp": "2025-03-17T09:55:11.906453600Z",
    "message": "Invalid payment method: CREDITCARD",
    "data": null
}
```
