# Order Payment Service with Redis

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements an **Order Payment Service** that integrates with `Redis` to publish payment status messages. It leverages `Spring Boot`, `Redis with Lettuce`, and a `structured event-driven approach` to notify other services about successful or failed payment transactions.

## ❓What is Redis?
`Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)` is an **in-memory, key-value data store known for its speed, flexibility, and scalability**. It is widely used for **caching, real-time messaging, session management, leaderboards, and job queuing**. It is often referred to as a **data structures server**. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.

### 🔥 Key Features of Redis
- ✅ Blazing Fast: Data is stored in memory, making reads/writes extremely fast.
- ✅ Supports Data Structures: Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets, Streams, Pub/Sub, etc.
- ✅ Persistence: Data can be persisted to disk using RDB (snapshotting) or AOF (append-only file).
- ✅ Scalability: Supports clustering and replication for high availability.
- ✅ Pub/Sub Messaging: Used for real-time notifications and distributed systems.

### Common Business Use Cases for Redis Message Types
Redis **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** is often used in business applications for **real-time event-driven messaging**. Here are some common message types:
#### 1. Order Processing System (E-commerce)

Message Types:
- ORDER_PLACED: When a customer places an order.
- PAYMENT_SUCCESS: Payment is successful.
- PAYMENT_FAILED: Payment is declined.
- ORDER_SHIPPED: Order has been shipped.
- ORDER_DELIVERED: Order is delivered to the customer.

✅ Use Case: Notify users in real-time about their order status.


#### 2. Payment Processing & Fraud Detection (Fintech)

Message Types:
- PAYMENT_INITIATED: When a user initiates a payment.
- PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED: When payment is authorized.
- PAYMENT_REJECTED: Payment failed due to insufficient funds or fraud detection.
- PAYMENT_REFUNDED: When a refund is issued.
- FRAUD_ALERT: When fraud is detected.

✅ Use Case:
- Notify customers of payment transactions.
- Alert fraud detection systems to take action.


#### 3. Notification & Alerts System

Message Types:
- NEW_MESSAGE: A user receives a new message in a chat app.
- NEW_COMMENT: Someone comments on a post.
- FRIEND_REQUEST: A new friend request is received.
- PROMOTIONAL_OFFER: A business sends discounts to customers.
- SYSTEM_ALERT: A critical error occurs (e.g., server downtime alert).

✅ Use Case:
- Real-time user notifications for chat apps like WhatsApp or Slack.
- Push notifications for social media updates.


#### 4. Real-Time Stock Market & Trading Platforms (Finance)

Message Types:
- STOCK_PRICE_UPDATE: Stock price updates every second.
- TRADE_EXECUTED: A stock trade is completed.
- MARKET_NEWS_UPDATE: News impacting the stock market.
- PORTFOLIO_ALERT: Portfolio value changes significantly.

✅ Use Case:
- Stock trading apps like Robinhood use Redis for real-time price updates


#### 5. IoT & Real-Time Sensor Data (Smart Devices)

Message Types:
- TEMPERATURE_UPDATE: Sends real-time temperature readings.
- MOTION_DETECTED: Security camera detects movement.
- DEVICE_HEALTH_CHECK: IoT device reports its health.

✅ Use Case:
- Smart home automation, monitoring energy consumption, and security alerts.

## ❓What is Lettuce?

`Lettuce` is a **scalable**, **high-performance**, and **non-blocking** Redis client for Java. It is also a **reactive and thread-safe** Redis client built on `Netty`. It supports both **synchronous and asynchronous (reactive)** interactions with Redis.

### 🔥 Key Features of Lettuce
- ✅ Supports Asynchronous & Reactive APIs (using CompletableFuture, RxJava, and Project Reactor)
- ✅ Thread-Safe Connections (multiple threads can use a single connection)
- ✅ Automatic Reconnection & Cluster Support
- ✅ Built on Netty (High Performance, Non-Blocking IO)
- ✅ Supports Redis Pub/Sub & Redis Streams

This project uses `LettuceConnectionFactory` to configure Redis connections with shared **ClientResources**. This connection factory is used by `RedisTemplate` to interact with Redis, enabling efficient message publishing and retrieval. The `RedisPublisher` service is responsible for publishing messages to the appropriate Redis channels (**PAYMENT_SUCCESS** and **PAYMENT_FAILED**).

---

## Order Payment Service

The **Order Payment Service** provides **REST APIs** to create and process payment transactions. The main flow involves:
1. Validating the Request - Ensuring the order exists, amount is valid, etc.
2. Calling Payment Gateway - Fetching transaction details (e.g., transactionId, paymentStatus).
3. Persisting Order Payment - Storing payment transaction details in the database.
4. Publishing Payment Status:
    - If paymentStatus = SUCCESS, publish to PAYMENT_SUCCESS channel.
    - If an exception occurs during processing, publish to PAYMENT_FAILED channel with an error message.

The `processPayment` method determines the flow based on paymentMethod (**CREDIT_CARD**, **PAYPAL**, **BANK_TRANSFER**), handling specific conditions for each type.

## ✨Tech Stack
The technology used in this project are:
- `Spring Boot Starter Web` – Provides essential components for building RESTful APIs.
- `Redis with Lettuce` – Message publishing

## 📋 Project Structure
The project is organized into the following package structure:
```bash

## 📂 Environment Configuration
Configuration values are stored in `.env.development` and referenced in `application.properties`.

Example `.env.development` file content:
```properties
# application
APP_PORT=8081
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=development

#redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_USERNAME=default
REDIS_PASSWORD=mypassword
REDIS_TIMEOUT=5
REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3
REDIS_LETTUCE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=10
```

Example `application.properties` file content:
```properties
# application
spring.application.name=redis-publisher-lettuce
server.port=${APP_PORT}
spring.profiles.active=${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE}

# redis
spring.data.redis.host=${REDIS_HOST}
spring.data.redis.port=${REDIS_PORT}
spring.data.redis.username=${REDIS_USERNAME}
spring.data.redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
spring.data.redis.timeout=${REDIS_TIMEOUT}
spring.data.redis.connect-timeout=${REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT}
spring.data.redis.lettuce.shutdown-timeout=${REDIS_LETTUCE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT}
```

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoanesber/Spring-Boot-Redis-Publisher-Lettuce.git
```

2. Ensure Redis is installed and running:
```bash
redis-server
```

3. Set up Redis user and password in `.env.development`
```bash
redis-server
```

4. (Optional) If you want to add a specific user with access to a specific channel, you can run the following command in Redis CLI:
```bash
ACL SETUSER your_user +CHANNEL~your_channel on >your_password
```

5. Build and run the application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

6. Use API endpoints to test payment processing.
